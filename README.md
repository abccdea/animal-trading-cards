| :---                    | :---                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Design                  | Page resembles card from design prototype.                                                                                                                                                        |
|                         | * The text is italicized for the animal’s interesting fact.                                                                                                                                       |
|                         | * The labels are bolded for the animal’s list items.                                                                                                                                              |
|                         | * The dots are removed from the animal's list items.                                                                                                                                              |
|                         | * Uses border around animal’s name, image, and information (interesting fact, list items, and description).                                                                                       |
|                         | * Uses border around animal’s information.                                                                                                                                                        |
|                         | * Uses spacing between animal’s name, image, and information.                                                                                                                                     |
|                         | * Card width should be fixed and include the spacing around the image (Since image is 300px wide, card should be 300px + spacing on either side. Card should not expand with the browser window). |
|                         | Feel free to customize your information and styles so long as you follow the above rules. For inspiration, you can try playing around with background colors or border radius!                    |
| Custom Image and Text   | The placeholder image and information is replaced with favorite animal image and information.                                                                                                     |
|                         | The image is 300px wide or the image's width is set to 300px.                                                                                                                                     |
|                         | The image’s __alt__ is relevant to the animal used.                                                                                                                                               |

### Code Quality


| __CRITERIA__            | __MEETS SPECIFICATIONS__                                                                    |
| :---                    | :---                                                                                        |
| CSS Classes             | The __HTML__ includes classes that are used for styling.                                    |
|                         | Classes are given meaningful names.                                                         |
| Separation of Concerns  | Student separates __HTML__ from __CSS__ by linking to stylesheet.                           |
|                         | __HTML__ code does not include __<style>__ elements or __style__ attributes in the body.    |
| Code Quality            | Code is ready for review, meaning new lines and indentation are used for easy readability.  |
